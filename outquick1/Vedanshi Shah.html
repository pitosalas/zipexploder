Both touch on challenges customers face, but they felt overlapping when describing what customers want to achieve and the obstacles they're trying to avoid. It took some effort to avoid repeating myself because, in my case with Horizon Tracker, the main job adventurers want is directly tied to their pain points—like the need for real-time tracking in dangerous environments, which is also their biggest frustration.</p><p>As for Keurig, I learned a lot about how they positioned convenience and variety as core value propositions. They solved the problem of brewing too much coffee and offered a wide range of flavors, which really appealed to diverse preferences. This made me realize that emphasizing Horizon Tracker's adaptability across different environments—whether it’s for a paraglider or a deep-sea diver—is similar to how Keurig highlighted variety. It reminded me to make personalization and flexibility a bigger part of our value proposition.</p><br><p></p></body></html>
