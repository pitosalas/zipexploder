If we used Keurigs as an example, we could say that the efficiency of making coffee is a customer benefit. Still, we can also say that for gain creators, the machine's ability to brew coffee quickly is the same as saying that it is efficient. Instead of using the typical razor and blades model, which could be costly for consumers, Keurig used a different model that focused not on the sale of replacing parts of the machine but on the K-cups as their goal was to increase coffee sales.</span></p></body></html>
