This is similar to the SAAS model we learned about in class. This is compared to the razors and blades buisness model because they all start with one base thing and then to continue using that thing you need to buy more product from that specific company. This sticks people into staying with one brand for at least some duation of time. I can't imagine that overall Keurig provides a positive consumer experience becase buyers are unable to use whatever type of coffee they want but the single serve coffee pods are good for communal use where you do not need to make a whole pot to have a cup of coffee. However, this buisness model creates revenue that is easy to predict and sales that can remain high due to the 'required' continued purchasing of Keurigs goods.&nbsp;</body></html>
