We learned about many different models of making money for hardware businesses. Keurig's was to sell the Keurig machine, which requires that you buy K-Cups. The majority of Keurig's profits do not come from selling the actual Keurig machines, but from the K-Cups. The K-Cups are relatively cheap, so consumers do not feel bad about using one every morning, which is why they are so profitable for Keurig. Unlike a Brita, razerblades, or a printer (where the hardware is cheap and the refills are expensive), Keurig users actually enjoy buying their refills. Because of this, Keurig bridges the gap between hardware companies (big purchases infrequently) and SaaS companies (cheap up front, rising profit over time). This is more like the model of video game consoles. Video games are so expensive, but people look forward to buying them. There is no point in buying and Xbox without games, but we don't begrudge Xbox for making us buy games, like we begrudge HP for making us buy more cartridges.&nbsp;<br></body></html>
