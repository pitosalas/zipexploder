It helped to think of the company perspective side as all of the parts our team had already discussed, such as what pain point the company was trying to solve and how this could benefit customers, but it was interesting to think of the new problems that would result from us solving an initial problem. A redundant part to fill out was the company's perspective of the products/services and the pain relievers mainly because I felt we had discussed this concept before.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">I've never owned a Keurig but I was surprised they were selling the coffee pods for so cheap but still able to make such a substantial profit.&nbsp;</p></body></html>
