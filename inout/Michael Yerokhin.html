I learned that Keurig leveraged the psychology of consumers by marking up their Keurig machine at $120, while their coffee was only a few dollars. This created the feeling that the Keurig machine was instead a instrument for using the actual product which is the coffee. Thus, buying coffee and refills feels less like a hassle and more of a necessity for buyers.</p></body></html>
