The gain creators show how walking the customer through the visa process will make it easier to get a visa and avoid any mistakes that might delay their application. Pain relievers include collecting all the information on different visas so users can easily access it, and giving step-by-step instructions on how to get the right one. There are also automated notifications for deadlines to make sure the visa process goes smoothly. The main job of the customer is planning to travel overseas, whether it's for school, vacation, or other reasons. Gains for the customer are wanting to get a visa easily, have a simple process, and not stress about it, while being confident in the service. The pains are the complicated nature of getting a visa and preparing for travel, which can be a long process with many chances to make mistakes.&nbsp;</span>Some parts of the canvas felt a bit redundant when it came to distinguishing between gains, gain creators, and pain relievers because they all overlap around solving the customer’s main problem. For example, explaining how the app simplifies the visa process and provides confidence in the service seemed to fit both as a gain creator and a gain, which made it challenging to clearly separate them without repeating ideas.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 0.9375rem;">As for Keurig, I learned that it’s a product that focuses on providing quick and convenient access to coffee, highlighting how important it is to address a specific customer pain point—saving time while still getting a good cup of coffee. It shows how understanding your customer’s daily struggles can lead to a product that effectively targets those needs.</span></p><p><br></p></body></html>
