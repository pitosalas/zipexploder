It is called razors and blades.&nbsp;Keurig's model differs psychologically from razors and blades. With razors and ink cartridges, consumers often feel frustrated and exploited when buying replacements. Conversely, with Keurig, people feel positive about purchasing coffee pods because theyâ€™re buying what they actually want and not a replacement part for the machine. This positive customer experience contrasts sharply with the negative emotions tied to the razor model. It is a fix to selling the cost of the consumable at a high price and selling the actual product at a reasonably lower price.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Parts of the canvas that were hard to fill out due to redundant were services and pain relievers because they were very similar.&nbsp;</p></body></html>
